# bspwm-dotfiles
My BSPWM + Arch/Void setup config and dotfiles 


This is the setup I use when running BSPWM on Arch/Void. 

The auto-setup should work to setup the config files. 
Zsh setup works, but you need to run it twice since it takes you to the ZSH prompt. 

Currently the script to install the packages are using pacman but to run it on Void (or any other distro) just change the syntax. 


For Void:

pacman -S ---> xbps-install 

xorg-server --> xorg


On Arch:

On Void:

![alt void][void.png "Dots on Void"]
